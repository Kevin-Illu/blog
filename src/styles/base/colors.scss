// backgrounds 1-2
// Steps 1 and 2 are designed for app backgrounds and subtle component backgrounds.
// You can use them interchangeably,
// depending on the vibe you're going for.

// components backgrounds 3-4-5
// Step 3 is for normal states.
// Step 4 is for hover states.
// Step 5 is for pressed or selected states.
// if the component has a transparent background
// you can use the step 3 for its hover state

// borders 6-7-8
// Step 6 is designed for subtle borders on components which are not interactive. 
// For example sidebars, headers, cards, alerts, and separators. 
// Step 7 is designed for subtle borders on interactive components. 
// Step 8 is designed for stronger borders on interactive components and focus rings.

// solid background 9-10
// Step 9 has the highest chroma of all steps in the scale. In other words,
// it's the purest step, the step mixed with the least amount of white or black.
// Step 10 is designed for component hover states,
// where step 9 is the component's normal state background.

// Steps 11â€“12: Text
// Step 11 is designed for low-contrast text.
// Step 12 is designed for high-contrast text.
